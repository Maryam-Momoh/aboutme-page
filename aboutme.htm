        <strong>HOOBIES</strong>
            <p>I don&apos;t have a lot of hobbies but i like getting in touch with my creative side.</p>
            <p>I find drawing to be surprisingly relaxing and stress reliving, I am currently in a drawing competition
                with my brother to see who is the family&apos;s Picasso (It&apos;s me anyways LOL).</p>
            <p>Reading is one of my subtle hobbies.I love reading novels, they are entertaining. i&apos;ve moved from reading just novels
            to reading inspirational books ,articles, basically anything with words.</p>   
        
        <strong>TALENTS</strong>
           <p>I don&apos;t think i have any talent per say at this point,but in high school i participated in a high jump sport and 
               i came second. My coach said i was a natural, but i didn&apos;t have an interest in it to be honest.</p>
            <p>I am also an aspiring nail tech, i design nails in my spare time and use henna to create designs.</p>

       <strong>GOALS</strong>
           <p>I&apos;m on my way to becoming a self taught programmer with my brother&apos;s help of course.</p>
           <p>I am currently learning HTML at the moment hence, this &ldquo;about me&rdquo; page.</p>
           <p>Someday i&apos;ll create an app for people dealing with mental health issues like depression
            and it&apos;s cousins and probably more apps about other stuff.</p>
        
        <strong>INTEREST</strong>
           <p>Photography is my new found interest, it brings out my creativity and i like to try out new things.</p>
           <p>Maybe oneday i&apos;ll own an art studio, who knows.</p>
